About this course

Want to understand the language of web? Eager to build your own website? This introductive course will bring you to the world of web. After step-by-step learning, you will lay a foundation for adding dynamic behavior, storing information, handling requests and responses on a website, etc.

JavaScript is arguably more difficult to learn than related technologies such as HTML and CSS. Before attempting to learn JavaScript, you are strongly advised to get familiar with these two technologies first. The detailed materials on HTML and CSS will also be given in our course.

Session 3: Introduction to CSS

    How CSS works
        In this section we start off with a theoretical grounding
    CSS syntax
        Let’s dive into CSS syntax in a lot more detail
    Selectors
        We are going to show what selector types are available and how they work
    CSS values and units
        In this guide, we look at more common values like length, colour and simple functions, as well as exploring less common units like degrees, and even unitless numerical values
    Cascade and inheritance
        This section covers two systems which resolve situations where you have selector conflicts and elements nested inside other elements in enough detail
    The box model
        This section introduce the foundation of layout on the Web
    Debugging CSS

    What is JavaScript?
        This section will ensure you are comfortable with JavaScript’s purpose
    A first splash into JavaScript
        Here you’ll build up a simple “Guess the number” game, step by step
    What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript
        This section aims to save you from tearing your hair out over such problems by providing you with some simple tips on how to find and fix errors in JavaScript programs
    Storing the information you need — Variables
        We will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work with most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables
    Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators
        We will discuss how we can combine operators and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding
    Handling text — strings in JavaScript
        We will look at all the common things that you really ought to know about strings when learning JavaScript
    Useful string methods
        We will start thinking about what useful operations we can do on strings with built-in methods
    Arrays
        We look at why this is useful, then explore detailed skills about arrays

    Making decisions in your code — conditionals
        We will explore how conditional structures work in JavaScript
    Looping code
        We will look at loop structures in JavaScript.
    Functions — reusable blocks of code
        We will explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define functions, scope, and parameters.
    Build your own function
        Here you’ll get some practice with building up your own custom function
    Function return values
