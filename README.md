About this course

Want to understand the language of web? Eager to build your own website? This introductive course will bring you to the world of web. After step-by-step learning, you will lay a foundation for adding dynamic behavior, storing information, handling requests and responses on a website, etc.

JavaScript is arguably more difficult to learn than related technologies such as HTML and CSS. Before attempting to learn JavaScript, you are strongly advised to get familiar with these two technologies first. The detailed materials on HTML and CSS will also be given in our course.
